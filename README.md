# My Arduino Lab

## Introduction
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that is easy to use, and it is a great way to get started with electronics and coding.
This repository contains my collection of beginner-friendly projects based on the open-source development platform Arduino that I use to learn programming.

## Getting Started
Before diving into the projects, make sure to set up your Arduino development environment:

- **Install Arduino IDE:** Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website. The IDE allows you to write scripts and upload them to your Arduino board.
- **Understand the Basics:** Familiarize yourself with basic electronics concepts and the Arduino language. The Arduino Getting Started Guide is a good resource.
- **Purchase an Arduino Board and Accessories:** There are various Arduino boards to choose from depending on your needs. Most projects in this repository can be completed with an Arduino Uno, which is a good board for beginners. Additionally, you'll need a USB cable to upload your scripts to the board, and various electronic components (like LEDs, resistors, sensors) depending on the project.
